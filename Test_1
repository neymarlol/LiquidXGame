Test 1

* The "Populate Array" function is spawning too many actors simultaneously,
  which will cause the game to freeze. To address this issue,
  the function should spawn only a few actors at a time, 
  over multiple frames.

* The "Print Array" function should take TArray by refrence so the function
  dont have to duplicate the var. It should also be const so user knows it wont
  mutate the variable

* Print Array function should log a few elements of the array at a time over multiple 
  frames to avoid any frame spikes and it should run sequencually with spawn actor function.

* Function calls must either be locked to prevent them from being called during this 
  process or have a system in place to handle multiple calls by keeping track of the 
  requested actors.

* It is possible to allocate large chunks of memory with FMalloc. 
  This method enables faster spawning of multiple actors, 
  as a single memory block can hold mulriple actors and only requires 
  one allocation call per chunk.
